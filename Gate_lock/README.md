As I had already failed on the previous crypto challenge I did not feel very compelled to do a lot of work on this one.
I figured out that the attachment was a minetest game file.

The content seemed very strange. It seems like I did not get the proper mod as when I looked up a write-up I saw that it was a logical circuit but in my version the switches were not working. I would have liked to enter the garden thingy in the game but I didnt want to spend to mutch time on this anymore.

I had seen this challenge before. Lifeoverflow has a series on the pwnisland game/challenge which was very entertaining that also has this kind of puzzle in it somewhere.<br />

part 13: Analyzing the Blocky Logic Puzzle

I did not realy solve this challenge to bad I did not get to this ending :(
