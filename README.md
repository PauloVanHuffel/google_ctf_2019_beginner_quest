# google ctf 2019: beginner quest
writeup + scripts of some challenges completed in the google ctf 2019 beginner quest

I participted for the first time in the beginner challenge last year. I almost got the cake but did not quite make it. Hope to do better this time.

I was not available during the ctf weekend so i am solving the challenges in the week(end) of the week after. I try to solve all challenges myself. However I did cheat a bit in the xss challenge, more about that will be explained in the writeup if i make one.
