writeup + scripts of some challenges completed in the google ctf 2019 beginner quest <br />
https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/

I participted for the first time in the beginner challenge last year(2018). I almost got the cake but did not quite make it. Hope to do better this time.

I was not available during the ctf weekend so i am solving the challenges in the week(end) of the week after. I try to solve all challenges myself.

I never include the flags themselves as I think accualy executing the needed steps will make one learn more than only reading the solution and then submitting the flag

I ended up breaking on the crypto challenge and did not solve the ones I had still open at this point. I ended up finding 10/13 flags and 3 out of 4 endings. I should have found 12/13 with one where I realy lacked the knowlegde to find it.

I found this edition in general more easy than the 2018 beginner quest. I'm very disapointed that I did not get all endings defenatly because I know i could have. I realy love that google CTF does these beginner quests. I learned more from last years version which is good as I hope this means I'm starting to have the basic knowledge needed to do the real challenges.

Last year I was not at all able to solve all challenges I just got trough one path that was leading to the end so I think I did quite a bit better this time.

Next year I hope I will be available on the CTF weekend. I will try for the first time to do a real challenge and in the week after try and solve all of the beginner quest the week after as I did now. I will try to wait a week after getting stuck before looking up solutions in hope to not give up to fast as i did on the crypto challenge 

I might during the rest of the year try and do one of the real challenges of this year if they are still live but i need a break for now.

Google CTF has realy become my measure of progress for my infosec knowledge. I hope to get to a point where I am able to participate as a team member in multiple CTF's and accualy be usefull :D

Again thanks google for making these challenges! It was again a lot of fun!
