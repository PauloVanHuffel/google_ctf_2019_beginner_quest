# google ctf 2019: beginner quest
writeup + scripts of some challenges completed in the google ctf 2019 beginner quest <br />
https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/

I participted for the first time in the beginner challenge last year(2018). I almost got the cake but did not quite make it. Hope to do better this time.

I was not available during the ctf weekend so i am solving the challenges in the week(end) of the week after. I try to solve all challenges myself.

I never include the flags themselves as I think accualy executing the needed steps will make one learn more than only reading the solution and then submitting the flag

I ended up breaking on the crypto challenge and did not solve the ones I had still open at this point. I ended up finding 10/13 flags and 3 out of 4 endings. I should have found 12/13 with one where I realy lacked the knowlegde to find it.

I found this edition in general more easy than the 2018 beginner quest. I'm very disapointed that I did not get all endings defenatly because I know I could have. I realy love that google CTF does these beginner quests. I learned more from last years version which is good as I hope this means I'm starting to have the basic knowledge needed to do the real challenges.

Last year I was not at all able to solve all challenges I just got trough one path that was leading to the end so I think I did quite a bit better this time.
Next year I hope I will be available on the CTF weekend. I will try to solve a real challenge for the first time and in the week after solve all of the beginner quest. A lesson learned from this year is that I should give it some more time when I'm stuck. I'd rather solve a challenge myself than get to all challenges in a timely manner.

Google CTF has realy become my measure of progress for my infosec knowledge. I hope to get to a point where I am able to participate as a team member in multiple CTF's and accualy be usefull :D

Again thanks google for making these challenges! It was again a lot of fun!

ps: This is the first time i'm making write-ups. The quality might be a bit poor but I really try to explain extensively to teach people with very minimal knowledge. I hope this content makes up for the lack in writing quality :D <br />
I might at least run this trough a spellingchecker later to remove the undoubtfully manny spelling mistakes later on.
