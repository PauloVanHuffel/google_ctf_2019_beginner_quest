https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/

I participted for the first time in the beginner challenge last year(2018). I almost got the cake but did not quite make it. Hope to do better this time.

I was not available during the ctf weekend so i am solving the challenges in the week(end) of the week after. I try to solve all challenges myself.

I never include the flags themselves as I think accualy executing the needed steps will make one learn more than only reading the solution and then submitting the flag
